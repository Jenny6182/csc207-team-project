# Team Contract

**Your team is free to revise this contract as your team wishes; we have scaffolded it with a recommended structure similar to the provided sample on Quercus.**

After you reflect on past teamwork experiences and brainstorm a list of actions required for a positive teamwork experience, answer these questions. 

Once you have all agreed on the contents of the team contract, make a PR to merge your team contract into the main branch of your team's repo on GitHub.

**Please remember to remove any of the initial instruction text when your team finalizes your team contract; it should resemble the provided sample once complete, but with details specific to the expectations and norms agreed to by your entire team.**

## Purpose of this Contract

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* Which platform will you use for communication outside of class, when required for work on your course project?
Discord

* Each teammate agrees to respond to messages in at most how long? 1 day? 2 days? Some other amount of time? 
Within 24 hours of the message being sent.

* What things should a teammate notify you about? (Examples: if they think they won't be able to meet a deadline, if they have to miss lecture, etc.)
If they think they won't be able to meet a deadline, if they have to miss lecture, if they have to miss lab, if they don't know how to do their part, if something's up and they won't be able to reply quickly

* Respectful and inclusive behaviour are necessary for smooth and productive communication. What are some respectful and inclusive behaviours you expect when communicating with each other during lectures, labs, or outside of class? (Examples: Actively listening to each team members ideas, giving everyone a chance to meaningfully contribute, etc.)

If we discuss something, everyone needs to be involved, listening to the discussion and think and share their idea.
Giving everyone a chance to meaningfully contribute (ask people who haven't spoken etc.).
Giving constructive feedback (start with something good, etc.)

### [Other Categories of norms and expectations go here]

* Based on your previous teamwork experiences, what other behaviours do you agree upon as a team?
    - some examples of possible additional team norms and expectations are included in the sample team contract in case your team needs some help getting ideas for what else you want to include.
    - Complete reading before lecture, listening and participating in group discussions in lecture.
    - Agree on a soft deadline for various tasks (which needs to be before the hard deadline).
    - Before merging or actually changing code, notify the entire team and make sure they are ok with it.
    - If someone needs help, try to help them if you can.

## Decision Making

* How will decisions about your team project be made? (Examples: By majority vote, by unanimous vote, etc.)
* If 4 out of 5 people agree, and everyone knows what decision is being made and given the chance to express and explain their opinion / persuade each other, etc.

---
## Conflict resolution

* How will your team resolve conflicts? (Example: by listening to each other's side of the issue and attempting to reach a compromise. By consulting a TA or instructor as a team, if a resolution has not yet been reached.)
*  By listening to each other's side of the issue and attempting to reach a compromise. By consulting a TA or instructor as a team, if a resolution has not yet been reached.
*  The rest of the team listen to each side, separately (like not in the same environment), and then communicate with the other one what the other person's thinking (to attempt to reach compromise).
*  When listening, don't favor someone or be biased.

---

## Accountability

* Reliability and accountability are also important aspects of teamwork. What are the responsibilities of each team member? (Example: completing their share of the work in a timely manner, seeking assistance from teammates/TAs/instructors when required, etc.)

Complete your share of work in a timely manner (like before a soft deadline). Seek assistance when required (but before seeking assistance make sure to try first).
(If you say you are going to do something, do it. If you have trouble with it, ask for help and don't keep quiet.)
